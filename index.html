          // Communication Skills
        </h2>
        <p>
          - Various communication skills I was able to excel at in school involves taking constructive criticism, <br> giving constructive criticism, delivering concise feedback, as well as presenting information <br>  in effective manners such as a presentation, or educating others through <br> other means.
        </p>

        <div id="skill2">
          <h2>
            // Critical Thinking
          </h2>
          <p>
            - Thinking critically is an important asset for me. I was able to demonstrate<br>this skill in many assignments I had while attending classes. Some of these assignments involve giving<br>solutions in an efficient manner, and potentially finding those solutions <br>in a time restricted environment.
          </p>

          <h2>
            // Teamwork
          </h2>
          <p>
            - Collaboration skills were a major aspect of most of my assignments in school. Both communication <br>and critical thinking skills were needed, but being able to utilise these skills<br> with other people in group projects I have had is much more important to ensure success.
